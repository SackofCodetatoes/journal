// given 2 integers, value and divisor, divide the value without using division, multiplcation or modulo
// approach would be to iterate over the values as string and determine how many times that value can be divided in that place. 
// 111 
///  2 divided
// 2 goes into 1 0 times, so we take 1 from the next place, and try again, 2 goes into 11 5 times leaving 1. 
// the remainder may or may not be relevant.
