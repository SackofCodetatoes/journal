Continued work on project view page. Made some better adjustments after playing around with the css. Really wish I took the care to organize my css and remove redundancies. However, the project was an early work and bounded to have some learning mistakes. Additionally ran into heroku push errors after reconfiguring machine to properly run rails. Unsure where bug stems from.

Need to work on in-place array algorithms. ex: return first repeated number, return lowested ascending value not in array problems. Respective tricks were to iterate over array and keep track of the visited elements with a pointer to the latest repeated starting from the end and to modify the array in respect to the growing lsit of integers, given the list must start at 1 and array and 1 being the lowest value.

Project plans: Work through revising splash page.
