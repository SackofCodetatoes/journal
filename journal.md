self note is not to apply for positions that don't neccesarily include skills i am very fluent at currently. Given that i have experience, it's not very wise to do so.



following very niche positions
phaiden internatonal stem field, life fields, financial services, civil engineers
nuced motors


allowed me to quickly implement my datamodels for users and user associated projects 


Love bringing things to life
graduated with bacheors in computer scienc eand engineering
worked independinetly in art and video game development, soon after fell in love with web development. 
enrolled in app academy to level up my skills 


My name is Jason and I love bringing ideas to life. I graduated from uc davis with a bachelors of science in computer science and engineering. After graduationg I worked independently in art and video game development to explore a creative path. Soon after I fell in love with web development as it blended my creative and engineering passions and decided to level up my skills by enrolling in app academy. I gained hands on experience in modern web frameworks and concepts such as React, ruby on rails, REST APIs, and relational databases like postgres. 

I think id be a great fit because I myself am a growth oriented self starer with experience working across the stack

I saw that wanderjaunt takes care to create amazing experiences, and as someone that loves to go through the iterative process, I'd love to develop that process. 



existing homeowners owners outa the picture and wanderjaunt takes care of it
design to activation team, redesign the place, works with other 3rd party travel agencies, take care of cehckins checkouts and cust service
win win can see from on airbnb 
4 % to 8 %

180 - 450

3rd market 

20 white collar hrly labr to move things
50 - 60 white collar
 second pillar to wander juant
 raise money under properties 
 buying homes for long term


 flexibility and ambiquity and engineers are more multifunctional
 product and consumer oriented


 what youd be doing
 straight forward, travel company book thru platform
 bookable thru airbnb
  they take a cut from that venue and want to increase ours
  more ui, page decrease functionality, web page optimization
  more operational side of things scheduling the night before
  more factors at demand basis
  warehouse management,
  artwork, phoneix austin, direct manufacturer partnerships
  data challenges at play, buy property to be efficient
  want tooling that sort of gud for the optmization and tooling to input data and predict





im interested in wanderjaunt because i feel id be a really great fit because I myself am self starter growth-oriented with experince working across the stack. 

dont say fit for the position

why i want to work at wanderjaunt
I love the iterative and transformation process behind wanderjaunt does, from acquiring potential venues, reimaginging the it's potential and creating a new experience. 

come up wiht the best u have

IBM meetup talk
applcation modernization on enterprise cloud stack
Will have a quiz to earn a badge later as part of the coder platform
What is app modernization and we keep evolving. bit better than the custom order
have to agree on a format within the appliaction and lead to service oriented architecture. data could descripbbe itself when transmitting data. there would be interfaces that was set in 
late 90s had custom interfaces . 10's had more standardized protocols 
2015 microservices using language agnostic apis and protocols

devs like to dive in and learn to swim
app modernization requires planning
biggest factor to modernize the app looks at business value and the cost and benefits from migrating
typically lots of buisness rules

good value usually found in apps that have 
  - multiple upgrades per year, 
  lots of buisness rules requring complex regression, testing and extended service ouotages to implement. large stable growng user base

also needs to account for how easy it is to migrate, technically
three ways to migrat is replatform, repackage, refactor

repackage involves repackaing of the app, breaking out the components, 

refactor rewrites the app on a modern platform

IBM cloud transformation advisor
can be pointed to jboss or 
migrate and check the errors that occur on the ibm cloud transformation advisor
checks to see how feasible it would be to move the application

underlying technologies required for the new environment

refactor what is necessary but dont necessarily refactor
what doesnt make sense to rewrite it from scratch
replatform takes legacy ap

containers and dockers
containers not a new idea, what is significant and docker containers is the overall ecosystem itself thats built upon its own library

how do containers work? processes run for the life time of the container
comparable to vm machine
have to map certain things 
running contained is fine but running multiple live is a lot mroe and less organized
use kubernetes will help organize the containers
containers developed by google since open source
kubernetes 
based on api system
client requests somethign in the enviornent, make request to storage, maps to storage and are monitored byb collection of watchers
which manage the enviornment
zero downpoint deployment, 
add pods to the application
once built, deploy to second level 

openshift container, ibm cloud private
 review the ibm and red hat replatofmred application, zero downtime.
 show 
 will show s
point is you always have a version of the app running

 key tenets of microservices architecture
 1. large monoliths are broken down into many small services
 2. services are optimized for a single function
 3. services are tightly encapsulated behind concrete programming interfaces
 3. communication via res api and or message brokers
 5. per-service continuous integration and continous deploayment
 per-service ha and clustering

 microservices fundamentals
 encapsulation is key, 
microservice as api enabler
micorservices architecture, review the slides

review the slides 
important to remember staging and deployment
take a chunk of functionality, bring it to cloud, implement as microservices and then deploy and will have small migrations


Since then I;ve been trying to grow myself as a developer by picking up and refining new skills such as web development using react, javascript, ruby, and relational databases.

for trapped water problem, we start with two pointers, left and right wall and increment the smaller of the two positions inwards. if the moving index finds an element greater than current wall, update it and iterate on the direction of the smaller of the two walls again
this will run in linear time and add all less than walls.points of data as captured water. if greater than, we jst update the

Google Interview Question
Given singly linked list and integer k, remove the kth element. Linked List might be very long and thus we can only iterate over the list in a single pass
Approach: Approach the problem with a few pointers. Offset pointer, index pointer, and previous pointer. index pointer will point to current index item as we iterate, offset will point to k elements behind index and previous will point to the elemennt previous to the offset. start by iterating index pointer by k elements. offset will point to root, previous will point to null or head. now as we iterate over elements, we updte our previous to offset, offset to offset.next and index to index.next until index.next is null. at end of list, we set our previous.next to point to offset.next as offset is kth element from end of list

Dodge, Data scientist
did a lot of buisness analssis and was also a bootcamp grad thats into data science 
Data scientist is person who is better at stats than any software engineer and better at oftware engineering than any statician. Need that stats background and be able to effectively communicate on
Thinkful Mentor Dodge Mcintosh

Data science project at a real company. Linkedin back in 2006 and how a scientist came in to work on pa project and the outcome of it
Johnathan was the datasceintist that joined LinkedIn and wanted to grow their numbers via statisticis. 
want to frame the question, collect raw data

after processing our data, we want to explore it, find the insights, distribution of variables and the findings behind the data. 

Be able to effectively tailor the information to the audience to be meaningful

1. Frame the question, What questions we want to answer?
What connection type and number lead to higher user engagement. 
which connections do people want to make but are currently limited from making
how might we predict these types of connections with limited data 

leads us to need to know connection data, demographic data, how are these people possibly connected? Collegues, vicinity? etc


how is data dirty and how can we clean it?
  user input
  redundancies
  feature changes
  data model changes
    Early linkedin was just entering data with no way to verify that data or just has typos
    possible connection question is people wiht similar responsiblities but differrent titles
    possible fix is have categoical dropdown information to clean up user input

what are the meaningful questions behind the data
  triangle closing
    im connected to john, johns conencted to arty, so maybe i should be connected to arty. Then we could look at other statistical data such as vicinity, location, etc to make a suggestion of being connected

How do we communicate this to be mroe meaningful?
  hey do x to gain y

out of that, we gained possible connections with othe rindividuals


Python and specific library to clean that data

lot of data is stored jupiter notebook and 
automate the boring stuff with python book which python will help us clean our code 

Scala also big in big data specialization

Will be building a model that will be a decission treem
  - predict the most likely outcome based on nput
  like a computer building a version of 20 questions
  regression problem is determingin a contiguious value, defined set
  the decisioin tree is will we play golf givn these conditions
  is a binary classification problem and is a biased learnign problem because we already know if we will play or not play. If we didnt have the outcome, it would not be biased

  Supervised learning is having all our historical data and unsupervised is not? Since we have all our information in our golf example, it is supervised

  unsupervised ex is customer segmentation information
    have purchase data, but no grouoping of the customers
    up to us to make useful differentiation

Collabortory - googles version of jupiter notebooks
juptr java python r notebook which works for us with python
allows us to run code on the notebook

with python, from sklearn, import tree
import pandas as pd
python uses DataFrame objects with our pandas

Dummy columns, sidekick elarn, need to convert categoriical info to converted to numerical representation. the get_dummies function creates a new DataFrame object that returns us dummied version
can use graphviz which is a visualization model which we copy the code to generate a decision tree model visual
interptable model = whitebox, blackbox = less interpertability
clf-train.predict() where clf-train was our model
double squre bracket passes in matrix
run thru our code and try it out with different temperatures or osmething 

decision trees are prety easy to get up n running and not worried about scaling after numerically encoded, but has some limitation
  limited data points that has been trained on

data analystic role isnt specifically all about this, data science is more on prediction
Dataquest and dataCamp is good intro/sources to data science
thinkful has free trials to learn more on python and statistics

Worked through more coding problems and noticing my problem with jumping ahead of myself. Need to remember to break down my steps on white boarding
1. Clarify the question + determine sample input
2. Create an approach, possibly with pseudo code
3. Talk about tradeoffs
4. Code 
5. Debug

Something else I'd like to focus on is more JavaScript trivia, given that I am appling also applying for frontend / web / JavaScript positions. Mason recommended the typical google search to find questions and keep a log of my findings which I will include. Additonally should check the job boards that mason recommended.

Mock with Mason
- Be clear on my approach and envelop my work.
 

Meeting with Adrian:
- Get referrals from people
- More clearbits
- Referral first, then apply. Clearbit to get the referral and then apply through the referral system
- Most of job search is networking and coding
- Talk to more people, more events


- 25 clearbits
- event by this Friday, required selfie
- 3 of which to be about combining passions, explicitly on 
- held accountable
- Reflect on WePay challenge

Given string of paranthesis and *, where * represents a wildcard, can be open or closed. determine if given string can be valid parenthesis.

My high level approach to a XOR Linked List, a more efficient doubly linked list that utilizes as both field instead of a previous and next by XOR-ing the previous and next. To build our XOR linked list, we build a class that takes can add a node and has reference to the root node and tail node. We have a root node and tail node pointer in order to append elements in our list in constant time and allow us to iterate in linear time. When adding a node into XOR LL, we create a node and set the both field to be the tail node XOR with some indicator, ex NULL as both refers to previous and next. Additoinally, we update the tail node's both field to be it's previous XOR with current new node. 

In order to iterate over the nodes, we start with a root and XOR the both field with NULL or an element we use to indicate the head/tail which returns us bitwise the next node. Dealing with pointers would give us that pointer. We then store the previous node's pointer and XOR with the next node's both field to repeat the process until we've managed the number of iterations we want.

Worked out interviewing problems involving more math and logic. Determined I need more work with the math related problems and develop a way to build a flow towards the answer. Working through 343 Integer break was fun as I created an approach based on a mathematical note of squared numbers. Additional plans I have soon is to partition my ubuntu system to so that I can install windows and work on some more passion projects. Hope thigns go well and I need to remember to make backups prior to installation.

Recruiter Panel Notes
- 10 secs to view, what to look for: tech stack & languages, related tech stack, certificates, background, typically online, 
- likes to look for C# and C++ due to knowing the fundamentals
- some also look for social good, volunteer work, (dependent)
- good description of your experience on the project and what it is
- segment - more customer facing and need more technical person looking for in depth knowledge
- Having passion, blurb. From trees, It might be more passion

pitfall
- tech stack sometimes too generic
- Presentable to hiring manager vs online presentation
- segment - lacking customer facing experience, like having long gaps and want to have more transferable skills. 
- Cant tell what you are, are you frontend, backend, product, etc?
    - if you are a specific engiener (identity), display it with summary, or objective or what you want to do. EX. say frontend, backend, full stack, etc
    - sometimes needs to determine years of experience
- do you really want to work here and stick around?


Coverletters
- not really looked at, typically just resume due to time, but there are some hr thta looks at coverletter
- some are required, coverletter should say what you bring to the company, market, market share, and evidence why you're passionate about the indiustry. If you can create a personal connection to the industry, that would be great and show
- paying atttention to the space is pretty important, like applying to bing despite the lower market share
- eye catching first liner, if not, prob wont look at. Segment is more dependent and want an answer to their unique questions
- Thank you letter 'is very important and here is what i heard', 'you will not regret hiring me'. Want to express that it is not a gamble
- personal part of the cover letter is very important. two sentences is bigger than a paragraph, depending on content


Postitives and pitfalls are sort of red flags 
What do you look for in tech interview
- can you learn, take ownership or large projects, 
- people should layout your approach and code isnt self explained
- Make sure to ask questions and clarify the question and make sure you sound excited
- try to sound excited about the interview
- dont bypass the recruiters
- speak about ME, I DID this and more on what you did
- be able to speak about ownership, facinated by challenges, showw enjoy facing obstacles and you have 30 mins to sell yourself. Be geunine, tell your story. KNOW WHO YOU ARE SPEAKING TO on call
- Be authentic with human element. Companies are investing on brand names and culture. Identify and brand yourself to fit with your group and who you are speaking to
project abotu ROI perspective so u can frame your language and project. Hard to explain what the value of your project will be to the organizaiton to someone not in your world
- speak about your we's and I's 
- Consulting, contract might be easier as less risk as they can cut you off easier. "Too early in the process to tell about culture and fit" but for contract work, better to have a number as it is more logistical. No culture and fit for contract work
- keep the confidence as you go through your call, ask about enxt steps but do stay positive, be prepared and do your research on your company. Go to glassdoor to be able to talk about it


What are the pitfalls to tech interview
- if someone seems stagnant, unwilling to learn, doing something the same. dont seize up, try to overcome. Don't force a method, but rather be flexible. Seizing up is more of a frustration and should be avoided. Be able to move past to a solution.
- layout the structure of the solution before jumping to the solution. Be clear while you whiteboard a solution. 
- try to avoid WE on projects or recruiter will pry for more info


onsite has 4 - 5 people 

Note- Trees is more of a learning problem while others are more traditional
- have key blurbs that recruiter can memorize as some are theere just to take notes
- recrutiers look everywhere. Recruiters do know some coding so know your brand, 
- Do your research about the project, better if I know ABC but can you dive deeper in A. Have enough ammunition to go into your content. Have your questions ready and be curious 
- know stage of company, funding, private, public, original founder, remaining foudners, understand the nuances and foudners story details the product and ask about the business model. Know as much as you can about the project. Have questions of how the product functions or such. 

Prove you can do what oyu can as recruiter needs to know the team built will be viable
be able to show your passion. Show what you are passonate with 

Biggest problem with False briefs? SOme are fans of open source or willing to get used to code

SEGMENT Panel
 - Customer Facing and Engineering is a big topic to looka t 
 - Success engineers - technical side of the customer facing, does not lie in engineering but rather revenue and buisness
 - have additional groups continuously with 8 peeps every 2 weeks now at 300 peeps

 Segment requires an api to gather data and their customers has to fill out forms. Segment takes the info and maintain

mroe for customer success engineer - can you relay your specific info to me
lots of work with success engineers move into engineering and looks at people passionate about engineering
Talks about here are the steps to taking them to where they want to go

for Segment, check out talent match, but it is viewing success engineering
Huge demand

Continued work on project view page. Made some better adjustments after playing around with the css. Really wish I took the care to organize my css and remove redundancies. However, the project was an early work and bounded to have some learning mistakes. Additionally ran into heroku push errors after reconfiguring machine to properly run rails. Unsure where bug stems from.

2/22/19
================================

Need to work on in-place array algorithms. ex: return first repeated number, return lowested ascending value not in array problems. Respective tricks were to iterate over array and keep track of the visited elements with a pointer to the latest repeated starting from the end and to modify the array in respect to the growing lsit of integers, given the list must start at 1 and array and 1 being the lowest value.

Project plans: Work through revising splash page.

2/21/2019
================================
Things to work on:
  Refine Project

Things to remember:
To keep organized and make it easier to engage the interviewer, follow the process
1. Ask clarifying questions to understand the problem better and to catch for edge cases
2. Find an approach tht works and possible more approaches that might lead to optimal
3. Talk about the tradeoffs of the different approaches
4. Write out the code
5. Test the code
