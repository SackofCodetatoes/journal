Continued work on project view page. Made some better adjustments after playing around with the css. Really wish I took the care to organize my css and remove redundancies. However, the project was an early work and bounded to have some learning mistakes.

Need to work on in-place array algorithms. ex: return first repeated number, return lowested ascending value not in array problems. Respective tricks were to iterate over array and keep track of the visited elements with a pointer to the latest repeated starting from the end and to modify the array in respect to the growing lsit of integers, given the list must start at 1 and array and 1 being the lowest value.

Project plans: Work through revising splash page.
