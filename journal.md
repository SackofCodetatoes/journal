Some things I'd like to keep in mind is keeping up the journal even when not much is going on and to keep ensure I can maintain my schedule of work and personal life together. Would prefer to do code related projects within the mornings and move onto personal engagements at night.

When CSS is too abundant, Reset the css on web tools and think big layout and go granular. 
Go through elements on html to be more efficient.

Continue css discussion next week tuesday after panel.

Continued work on project view page. Made some better adjustments after playing around with the css. Really wish I took the care to organize my css and remove redundancies. However, the project was an early work and bounded to have some learning mistakes. Additionally ran into heroku push errors after reconfiguring machine to properly run rails. Unsure where bug stems from.

Need to work on in-place array algorithms. ex: return first repeated number, return lowested ascending value not in array problems. Respective tricks were to iterate over array and keep track of the visited elements with a pointer to the latest repeated starting from the end and to modify the array in respect to the growing lsit of integers, given the list must start at 1 and array and 1 being the lowest value.

Project plans: Work through revising splash page.
