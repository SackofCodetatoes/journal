Recruiter Panel Notes
- 10 secs to view, what to look for: tech stack & languages, related tech stack, certificates, background, typically online, 
- likes to look for C# and C++ due to knowing the fundamentals
- some also look for social good, volunteer work, (dependent)
- good description of your experience on the project and what it is
- segment - more customer facing and need more technical person looking for in depth knowledge
- Having passion, blurb. From trees, It might be more passion

pitfall
- tech stack sometimes too generic
- Presentable to hiring manager vs online presentation
- segment - lacking customer facing experience, like having long gaps and want to have more transferable skills. 
- Cant tell what you are, are you frontend, backend, product, etc?
    - if you are a specific engiener (identity), display it with summary, or objective or what you want to do. EX. say frontend, backend, full stack, etc
    - sometimes needs to determine years of experience
- do you really want to work here and stick around?


Coverletters
- not really looked at, typically just resume due to time, but there are some hr thta looks at coverletter
- some are required, coverletter should say what you bring to the company, market, market share, and evidence why you're passionate about the indiustry. If you can create a personal connection to the industry, that would be great and show
- paying atttention to the space is pretty important, like applying to bing despite the lower market share
- eye catching first liner, if not, prob wont look at. Segment is more dependent and want an answer to their unique questions
- Thank you letter 'is very important and here is what i heard', 'you will not regret hiring me'. Want to express that it is not a gamble
- personal part of the cover letter is very important. two sentences is bigger than a paragraph, depending on content


What do you look for in tech interview
- can you learn, take ownership or large projects, 

What are the pitfalls to tech interview
- if someone seems stagnant, unwilling to learn, doing something the same


Note- Trees is more of a learning problem while others are more traditional


Project overviews:
Constructables
  - Built full stack application with Ruby on Rails framework, PostgreSQL, React, JavaScript, and Redux

Grouple:
  - used axios


Noticed to fix items: 
  - Magnify glass on constructables
  - Related project datas



Routine to follow:
Morning:
  - 3 leet code problems
  - Work on some project goal
    - if no goals, create some and work on it incrementally for a project

Some things I'd like to keep in mind is keeping up the journal even when not much is going on and to keep ensure I can maintain my schedule of work and personal life together. Would prefer to do code related projects within the mornings and move onto personal engagements at night.

================================
When CSS is too abundant, Reset the css on web tools and think big layout and go granular. 
Go through elements on html to be more efficient.

Continue css discussion next week tuesday after panel.
CTOS or CEOs, hiring managers, or recruiters.

730px is a magic sweetspot

Continued work on project view page. Made some better adjustments after playing around with the css. Really wish I took the care to organize my css and remove redundancies. However, the project was an early work and bounded to have some learning mistakes. Additionally ran into heroku push errors after reconfiguring machine to properly run rails. Unsure where bug stems from.

Project plans: work on Project view page
Reworked some basic views on project view
Need to consider learning coding organizatoin and invest in the time while working on projects to for longterm readability/viability.
================================
2/22/19
================================

Need to work on in-place array algorithms. ex: return first repeated number, return lowested ascending value not in array problems. Respective tricks were to iterate over array and keep track of the visited elements with a pointer to the latest repeated starting from the end and to modify the array in respect to the growing lsit of integers, given the list must start at 1 and array and 1 being the lowest value.

Project plans: Work through revising splash page.

3. Talk about the tradeoffs of the different approaches
4. Write out the code
5. Test the code
